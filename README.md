Moronic runner, beautiful but dumb.

morun aims to be the goto runner for users wanting a clean, "pretty" and
usefull runner. For now morun is really dumb - it can only run applications.

Make and run using:

```bash
$ make
$ ./morun -s style.css
```

morun aims to have support for the following:

* Autocompleting applications
* Autocompleting paths
* Opening urls (currently working by running `firefox www.scala-lang.org`)
* Simple calculator
* History

Pull requests welcome!
